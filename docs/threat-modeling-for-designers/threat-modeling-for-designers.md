# Threat Modeling for Designers

This is a living, work-in-progress documentation to shape how _Threat Modeling_ (borrowing from security field) might look like for designers. 

Note: Based on the feedback from few 18F designers, "threat modeling" as a concept may be not be palatable for designers who are not familiar with security, so we are exploring other names for it, e.g. "risk assessment" to create a bridge for designers into the world of security. With this mind, we would frame this resource as a way to help designers strategize how to build safer platforms.

We welcome collaboration on this documentation.

## Why

As a resource, _threat modeling for designers_ will help designers:

1. Understand the threats users face in design, and how designers can identify and prevent harm to their users
2. Make security more manageable
3. Collaborate with partner(s) and colleagues to develop an understanding of our/their assets, adversaries, and capabilities

## How

### Questions we have about the resource itself

- High-level, "How might..." questions to ask ourselves
  - When might threat modeling for designers be useful?
  - When might threat modeling for designers not be useful, and/or in turn, actively harm?
  - How might threat modeling change over time? And how would we maintain/care for it?

- Additional questions

### Identify and research real world cases and examples

- Discover how they are addressed, resolved or not, etc.
- Identify both external and internal (18F/TTS) cases/examples

## When

In practice, this resource would be part of pre-mortem.

## Resources

**Note:** When researching resources, be aware of authors' backgrounds and biases â€” Security and threat modeling are heavily authored by a certain demographic, and instead make an effort to find authors from various backgrounds, especially those who are likely to experience vulnerable situations.
